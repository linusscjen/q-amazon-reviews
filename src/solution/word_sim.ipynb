    "For this second NLP project, I will be using various NLP tactics to fill in for missing data, specifically those in the `BULLET_POINTS` and `DESCRIPTION` columns. To do this, first I'll be using `spaCy` to extract keywords, and then using `GPT-J` (or another GPT equivalent model) to combine these keywords into a description. This would help Amazon vendors with filling out information quicker, as they can get succinct descriptions given their product's title."
